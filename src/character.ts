        "---eip: 20title: Token Standardauthor: Fabian Vogelsteller <fabian@ethereum.org>, Vitalik Buterin <vitalik.buterin@ethereum.org>type: Standards Trackcategory: ERCstatus: Finalcreated: 2015-11-19---## Simple SummaryA standard interface for tokens.## AbstractThe following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.## MotivationA standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.## Specification## Token### Methods**NOTES**: - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above) - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!#### nameReturns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.``` jsfunction name() public view returns (string)```#### symbolReturns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.``` jsfunction symbol() public view returns (string)```#### decimalsReturns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.``` jsfunction decimals() public view returns (uint8)```#### totalSupplyReturns the total token supply.``` jsfunction totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)```#### balanceOfReturns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.``` jsfunction balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)```#### transferTransfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.``` jsfunction transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)```#### transferFromTransfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.``` jsfunction transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)```#### approveAllows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.THOU The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before``` jsfunction approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)```#### allowanceReturns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.``` jsfunction allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)```### Events#### TransferMUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.``` jsevent Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)```#### ApprovalMUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.``` jsevent Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)```## ImplementationThere are already plenty of ERC20-compliant tokens deployed on the Ethereum network.Different implementations have been written by various teams that have different trade-offs: from gas saving to improved security.#### Example implementations are available at- [OpenZeppelin implementation](../assets/eip-20/OpenZeppelin-ERC20.sol)- [ConsenSys implementation](../assets/eip-20/Consensys-EIP20.sol)## HistoryHistorical links related to this standard:- Original proposal from Vitalik Buterin: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Standardized_Contract_APIs/499c882f3ec123537fc2fccd57eaa29e6032fe4a- Reddit discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3n8fkn/lets_talk_about_the_coin_standard/- Original Issue #20: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20## CopyrightCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](../LICENSE.md).",
